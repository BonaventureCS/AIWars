AIWars
======

UB Hacking 2013 project.

AI Wars is a web application that provides programmers a unique environment 
to create their own AI for various popular games (i.e. Tic-Tac-Toe). They can
then have their AI go up against other programmer's AI to win bragging rights.

AI Wars was programmed and demoed in a 24 hour period at UB Hacking 2013.

The team consisted of:
Thomas Bartlett,
Coty Collins,
Brandon Kowalski &
Levis Lewis.
